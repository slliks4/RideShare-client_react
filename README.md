Church Ride-Share Application
Project Overview

The Church Ride-Share Application is a specialized transportation platform designed to facilitate ride-sharing for church members attending various events and sessions. Unlike typical ride-hailing services, this application is centered around scheduled church activities, allowing members to request rides to and from church events seamlessly.
Key Features

    Admin Session Management:
        Admins can create and manage church sessions, including recurring events.
        Sessions have customizable recurrence rules, with options for specific days, months, and years.
        Automatic session activation and deactivation based on start and end dates.

    Driver Operations:
        Drivers can log in to view and manage pre-assigned trips based on their preferences and availability.
        Real-time request handling, with options to accept or decline rides.
        Drivers can view detailed trip information, including rider details and optimal routes.
        Post-trip feedback system to refine driver preferences and enhance the overall experience.

    Rider Experience:
        Riders can only request rides for available sessions within a 12-hour window before the event.
        Easy ride booking process with auto-filled addresses and customizable occupancy.
        Real-time notifications for ride status, including driver details and pickup times.
        Post-ride feedback and rating system to improve service quality.

    Additional Features:
        Notification System: Real-time updates and reminders for both drivers and riders.
        Emergency Support: Emergency button and support contact for drivers.
        Trip History & Analytics: Detailed trip history and performance analytics for drivers.
        Safety & Compliance: Regular compliance checks for drivers and vehicles, with verification processes for added security.

Project Goals

The primary objective of this application is to provide a reliable and efficient ride-sharing solution tailored to the needs of church communities. By focusing on scheduled events, the application ensures that transportation is available when needed, fostering better attendance and community engagement.









# App Logic
Decided to go with a single App.jsx to handle all the app logic like appState, providers, routing, permissions etc.
## Reason
1. It makes the code base much easier to navigate
2. The lines of code is still below 300 and for me I rather much focus on one page than having complex navigation within code base for 6 lines of Code
